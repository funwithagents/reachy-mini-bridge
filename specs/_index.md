# Reachy Mini Bridge

Reachy Mini Bridge sits between the Reachy Mini robot's API and the things that want to drive it. It wraps the robot's native API, adds its own management and higher-level APIs layered on top (mediating and orchestrating between the underlying endpoints), and exposes tools that let agents and LLMs perceive and control the robot. The core idea is a single, stable bridging layer so callers — human, service, or agent — never talk to the raw robot API directly.

## Specs

<!-- One row per concept spec. Keep the Status column in sync with each spec's `**Status:**` line. -->

| Spec | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [project.md](project.md) | Project structure and tooling: Python version, packaging with uv, layout conventions | Implemented |
| [testing.md](testing.md) | Testing strategy: two-tier `tests/`/`tests-e2e/` split, functional-test philosophy, skip-without-credentials live tier | Implemented |
| _(add concept specs here — see [_spec-template.md](_spec-template.md))_ | | |

Each spec also opens with a YAML **frontmatter** block declaring the `code:` and `tests:` files it governs — the spec → code/tests mapping the spec-drift checks use to scope what they compare. Keep it current when files move, and see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) ("Spec frontmatter") for the full convention.

### Status legend

- **Not started** — no design decisions made yet
- **Draft** — actively being brainstormed/defined, contains open questions
- **Stable** — design settled, reviewed and validated (open questions are deferrals only), **ready to implement but not necessarily implemented yet**. This is the design-review gate, before code is written.
- **Implemented** — a **Stable** spec that a `Done` plan has built: the code now exists and matches the spec (design and code in sync)
- **Updated** — an **Implemented** spec since edited in a way that needs new code, so the code no longer matches it; a new implementation plan is needed (or in progress) to catch up. Returns to **Implemented** once that plan is `Done`.
